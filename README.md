As a Tableau developer, I'm excited to share with you the dashboard I've created to help you answer key questions about your workforce. In this Dashboard, I'll walk you through the different components of the dashboard and explain how it can help you improve retention and job satisfaction within your organization.

First, we have the Employee Count card, which displays the total number of employees currently working in your organization. This provides a high-level overview of your workforce.

Next, we have the Attrition Count and Attrition Rate cards, which display the number of employees who have left your organization in the last year and the attrition rate as a percentage of the total number of employees, respectively. By monitoring these metrics, you can gain insight into the turnover rate within your organization and take steps to reduce it.

There is also an Education dropdown filter that allows you to filter the data based on the education level of employees. This filter can be used in conjunction with the Education Field by Attrition horizontal bar chart to gain deeper insights into attrition rates based on specific education levels.
By selecting a specific education level from the dropdown filter, the Education Field by Attrition chart will update to show the attrition rate for each education field within that selected education level. This can help identify any disparities in retention rates based on education level and field.

The Active Employees card displays the number of employees currently working in your organization. This is important to keep track of, as it can impact workload and staffing needs.

The Average Age card displays the average age of employees in your organization. This can be useful to identify trends in age demographics and ensure that your workforce is diverse and inclusive.

The Attrition by Gender horizontal bar chart displays the attrition rate by gender. This chart is color-coded to represent male and female employees and is sorted in descending order by attrition rate. This can help identify any gender disparities in retention rates.

The Department by Attrition pie chart displays the proportion of attrition across different departments. This chart is color-coded to represent each department and is sorted in descending order by the proportion of attrition. This can help identify departments that may need extra support in retaining employees.

The Number of Employees by Age Group horizontal bar chart displays the number of employees in each age group. This chart is color-coded to represent each age group and is sorted in ascending order by age group. This can help identify trends in age demographics and ensure that your workforce is diverse.

The Job Satisfaction Rate highlight table displays the job satisfaction rate for each department. This table is color-coded to highlight departments with low job satisfaction rates. This can help identify departments that may need extra support in improving job satisfaction.

The Education Field by Attrition horizontal bar chart displays the attrition rate by the education field. This chart is color-coded to represent each education field and is sorted in descending order by the attrition rate. This can help identify any disparities in retention rates based on education level.

Finally, the Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups donut chart displays the attrition rate by gender for different age groups. This chart is color-coded to represent male and female employees and is sorted in descending order by the attrition rate. This can help identify any gender and age disparities in retention rates.

By utilizing this dashboard, you can gain valuable insights into the state of your workforce and take action to improve retention and job satisfaction within your organization. With the help of Tableau, you can turn data into actionable insights and create a more productive and satisfied workforce.
